# Linea Relazione

*Sound, line, and emergent meaning*

A generative audiovisual project exploring how emotion and meaning are communicated through sound before language exists.

## Concept

Music is built from **units of sonic intention** — gestures of pitch, rhythm, timbre, and movement that humans understand pre-linguistically. In Linea Relazione, these sonic intentions translate into behavioral logic governing autonomous line agents.

Lines behave as agents responding to **musical forces** (flow, melody, rhythm, density, harmony, timbre). Meaning emerges not from symbols, but from relational interaction: clustering, separation, convergence, drift.

## Tech Stack

- **React Three Fiber** + Three.js (3D rendering)
- **Tone.js** (audio playback)
- **TypeScript** (type safety)
- **Vite** (build tool)

## Project Structure

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete framework.

Key directories:
- `src/composition/` - Authored force scores (the secret sauce)
- `src/agents/` - Line agent system with emergent behavior
- `src/forces/` - Musical force → behavior parameter translation
- `src/audio/` - Playback + micro-variation extraction
- `compositions/` - Individual works with audio + force scores

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Current Phase

**Phase 0: Foundation** ✓  
Next: **Phase 1 - Core Agent System** (autonomous lines with local awareness)

## Philosophy

This is not an audio visualizer. The machine doesn't simulate emotion — it participates in the same vibrational logic that underpins music, physical matter, and collective behavior.

Meaning emerges through interaction, not representation.
