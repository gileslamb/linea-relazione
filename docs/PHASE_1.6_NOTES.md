# Phase 1.6: Visual Immersion Attempt

**Branch:** `phase-1.6-pointillism-bloom`  
**Tag:** `v1.6-immersion`

## What Was Added
- Bloom post-processing (glow effect)
- Pointillism particles
- Cloud particle clusters
- Soft blue-white color palette

## What Worked
- Bloom creates luminous quality
- Layered visual complexity

## What Didn't Work
- Movement too rigid ("helicopters spinning")
- Lines need to be curves, not straight
- Pointillism not visible enough
- Needs more organic, flowing quality

## Next: Phase 1.7
- Replace lines with bezier curves
- Map sliders to musical concepts (harmony/dissonance, etc.)
- Add shape formation
- More glow/effervescence
